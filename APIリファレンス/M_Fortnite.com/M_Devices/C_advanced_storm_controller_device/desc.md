# Used to control a Battle Royale-style storm with up to 50 phases

Like basic_storm_controller_devices, you can use this storm to keep players inside a playable area, but unlike the basic_storm_controller_device, this device generates multiple storm phases. When used in conjunction with advanced_storm_beacon_devices, you can customize each phase of the storm by applying one or more beacons and setting customization options for the specific phase you assign to that beacon.
